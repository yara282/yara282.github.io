                <h3> survival mode :- </h3>

                        In survival mode, players have to gather natural resources such as wood and stone found in the environment in order to craft certain blocks and items.
                        Depending on the difficulty, monsters spawn in darker areas outside a certain radius of the character, requiring players to build a shelter at night.
                        The mode also has a health bar which is depleted by attacks from mobs, falls, drowning, falling into lava, suffocation, starvation, and other events.
                        Players also have a hunger bar, which must be periodically refilled by eating food in-game (except in peaceful difficulty).
                        If the hunger bar is depleted, automatic healing will stop and eventually health will deplete.
                        Health replenishes when players have a nearly full hunger bar or continuously on peaceful difficulty.
                        Players can craft a wide variety of items in Minecraft.
                        Craftable items include armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or hoes), which break certain types of blocks more quickly.
                        Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. Players can construct furnaces, which can cook food, process ores, and convert materials into other materials.
                        Players may also exchange goods with a villager (NPC) through a trading system, which involves trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.
                        The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.
                        Upon dying, items in the player's inventories are dropped unless the game is reconfigured not to do so.
                        Players then re-spawn at their spawn point, which by default is where players first spawn in the game and can be reset by sleeping in a bed or using a respawn anchor.
                        Dropped items can be recovered if players can reach them before they disappear or despawn after 5 minutes.
                        Players may acquire experience points by killing mobs and other players, mining, smelting ores, breeding animals, and cooking food.
                        Experience can then be spent on enchanting tools, armor and weapons.
                        Enchanted items are generally more powerful, last longer, or have other special effects.
